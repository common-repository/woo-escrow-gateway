The Escrow Payments on WooCoomerce extension allows you to add Escrow.com payments to your WooCommerce store.

== Description ==
Escrow.com provides a secure payment solution for your website, marketplace, classified site, shopping cart or mobile app with no chargebacks, ever.

Escrow.com is especially useful in situations where buyers and sellers do not know each other, do not trust each other, or where large sums of money are exchanging hands. Rates are as low as **0.89%**.

This plugin allows you to add Escrow.com as a payment option on your checkout page in WooCommerce.

== Installation ==

1. Install the **Escrow Payments on WooCoomerce** extension directly via the WordPress plugin directory or download the latest from [our plugin page on WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-escrow-gateway/) and upload the **woocommerce-gateway-escrow.zip** file via the WordPress plugin upload page.
1. Activate the plugin through the **Plugins** menu in WordPress.
1. Once you have activated the plugin, navigate to the settings page under **WooCommerce** / **Settings** / **Payments** / **Escrow.com**.
1. The settings page allows you to configure the plugin to your liking.
1. Your Escrow Email is the email address you used to create an account on either escrow.com or escrow-sandbox.com. The escrow.com environment is the production environment and is used for live transactions. The escrow-sandbox.com environment is for testing. Make sure the credentials you enter match the selected environment. These are two separate environments, so creating an account in one environment does not mean that it will be duplicated in the other environment.
1. [Create a production account here](https://www.escrow.com/integrations/signup) and [create a sandbox account here](https://www.escrow-sandbox.com/integrations/signup).
1. Enable the Escrow.com payment option on your checkout page by checking the **Enable Escrow.com Payment Method** check box on the settings page and clicking **Save** at the bottom of the screen.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= What happens after an order has been placed? =

Escrow.com is an offline payment method. Once an order has been placed, the buyer will be instructed to log into Escrow.com to submit payment and get their identity verified if applicable.

As a WooCommerce store owner, you are either the seller in the transaction in single-vendor scenarios or the broker in multi-vendor scenarios. In both of these cases, you will need to log into Escrow.com to move each order forward. In multi-vendor scenarios, each vendor will also need to participate in each transaction that they are a party to in order for those transactions to move forward.

= An error occurs when someone places an order with the Escrow.com payment option. What do I do? =

If an error occurs when a user places an order with the Escrow.com payment option selected, open the WooCommerce admin and navigate to **Status** and then **Logs**. This plugin writes debug and error messages to these logs. They may be under **fatal-** or **log-**. If a **401** or **403** error is being returned from the Escrow.com API, then there is a problem with the Escrow.com credentials. If a **500** error is being returned, there is a problem on the Escrow.com server. When that happens, please email [plugins@escrow.com](mailto:plugins@escrow.com) and we will investigate.

== Changelog ==

= 2.4.1 =
* Fixed a bug where commission type is not valid when Multi-Vendor Extension is enabled and WC Vendor Pro is being used.

= 2.4.0 =
* Added a fix when calling the function get_cart in woocommerce admin view. Change the plugin name to Escrow Payments on WooCoomerce.

= 2.3.0 =
* The British pound (GBP) has been added to the Currency drop down list on the Escrow.com settings page. When selected all transactions will be denominated in GBP.

= 2.0.0 =
* Buyers placing orders on the WooCommerce checkout page are now redirected to the new streamlined Escrow.com Pay workflow. This allows the buyer to register, verify, and pay all from a single page on Escrow.com. This replaces the old workflow which unnecessarily bounced the buyer around to various parts of Escrow.com.
* When the shopping cart contains products from a single vendor at the time of checkout, the buyer is redirected directly to Escrow.com, not to the WooCommerce order receipt page (the buyer used to have to click through to Escrow.com from here).
* When the shopping cart contains products from multiple vendors at the time of checkout, the buyer is redirected to the WooCommerce order receipt page, which displays a button to the Escrow.com Pay workflow for each vendor in the order.
* The Escrow.com Pay workflow redirects the buyer back to the WooCommerce order detail page when they have finished paying for their order on Escrow.com.
* To avoid a potential issue when upgrading to version 2.0.0, please re-save your settings on the Escrow.com settings page. Make sure that the desired Escrow API URL is selected; note that this now contains only the root URL (e.g. https://api.escrow.com/), not any additional path information (e.g. https://api.escrow.com/2017-09-01/).
